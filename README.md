### Train the model

To re-train a different model or see the existing model, check the [training notebook](training.ipynb)

### Test the app locally

```
cd app/

pip install -r requirements.txt

python app.py
```

### Deploy the app to heroku

First of all make sure you have a heroku account and heroku CLI installed

Then just use the following commands from the root of the repository

```
heroku login

heroku create <your-app-name-here>
```

Now we are going to push only the app folder to heroku, since the other files are irrelevant for production

```
git subtree push --prefix app/ heroku master
```

And That's pretty much it ! Our app is now running on the cloud and available for anyone to check
